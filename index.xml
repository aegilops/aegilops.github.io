      <description>Regex for GitHub Secret Scanning Regular Expressions (regex) are the butt of many a joke - &amp;ldquo;now you have two problems&amp;rdquo;, but they&amp;rsquo;re a powerful tool for searching and matching text.

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Paul ðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m Paul, aka aegilops. That&amp;rsquo;s my GitHub handle. It means nothing deeper than being a word with all of the letters in alphabetic order, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t already taken! It&amp;rsquo;s said ee-ji-lops (or ËˆÄ“-jÉ™-ËŒlÃ¤ps for anyone who knows IPA).
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a background in computer security, having done a couple of decades of network security, AppSec, vulnerability research and research &amp;amp; development.
I started work at GitHub at the end of May 2022.</description>
