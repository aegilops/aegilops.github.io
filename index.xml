      <title>Partial Flow in CodeQL With ConfigSig</title>

      <description>CodeQL is an ever-evolving static code analysis engine, which powers GitHub&amp;rsquo;s SAST.
It&amp;rsquo;s powerful, but it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, and sometimes you need to debug queries to understand why they&amp;rsquo;re not behaving as you&amp;rsquo;d expect.
One great tool for that is &amp;ldquo;partial paths&amp;rdquo;, which lets you see the dataflow or taint steps that a query is flowing over, so you can see where the flow might have broken between a source and a sink.</description>

      <title>I wrote a Python Linting Code Scanning Action</title>

      <description>A GitHub Action to lint Python code, for GitHub Code Scanning Recently I ran a training &amp;ldquo;bootcamp&amp;rdquo; for a customer on GitHub Advanced Security, and the topic of code quality came up.
Pinning down just what we mean by &amp;ldquo;code quality&amp;rdquo; can be a bit tricky: witness the debates over Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s work on &amp;ldquo;clean code&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that it&amp;rsquo;s often about other factors of the code than the security of the code, which is the main focus of Advanced Security (the clue is in the name).</description>

      <title>New Github Secret Scanning Custom Patterns</title>

      <description>GitHub Secret Scanning gives loads of value off-the-shelf, with highly precise vendor secret detection, but sometimes a customer wants something that isn&amp;rsquo;t already covered by the built-in patterns.
For that, our custom patterns for Advanced Security are perfect, and I&amp;rsquo;ve just released some that I&amp;rsquo;ve written for a couple of customers (and also on a whim).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the list:
.NET Configuration file, e.g. &amp;lt;add key=&amp;quot;password&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;somesecret&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; .NET machineKey, e.g. &amp;lt;machineKey validationKey=&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>Regex for GitHub Secret Scanning</title>

      <description>Regex for GitHub Secret Scanning Regular Expressions (regex) are the butt of many a joke - &amp;ldquo;now you have two problems&amp;rdquo;, but they&amp;rsquo;re a powerful tool for searching and matching text.
As someone who&amp;rsquo;s been jokingly called &amp;ldquo;The King of Regex&amp;rdquo; ðŸ‘‘ before, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little bit to say about them.
They&amp;rsquo;re used in many places, including GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Secret Scanning, where as part of Advanced Security they give you the ability to match your own patterns to search for secrets or personal data (or anything you like!</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Paul ðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m Paul, aka aegilops. That&amp;rsquo;s my GitHub handle. It means nothing deeper than being a word with all of the letters in alphabetic order, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t already taken! It&amp;rsquo;s said ee-ji-lops (or ËˆÄ“-jÉ™-ËŒlÃ¤ps for anyone who knows IPA).
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a background in computer security, having done a couple of decades of network security, AppSec, vulnerability research and research &amp;amp; development.
I started work at GitHub at the end of May 2022.</description>
