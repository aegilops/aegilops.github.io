<p>I&rsquo;m Paul, aka <a href="https://github.com/aegilops">aegilops</a>. That&rsquo;s my GitHub handle. It means nothing deeper than being a word with all of the letters in alphabetic order, which wasn&rsquo;t already taken! It&rsquo;s said ee-ji-lops (or ˈē-jə-ˌläps for anyone who knows IPA).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a background in computer security, having done a couple of decades of network security, AppSec, vulnerability research and research &amp; development.</p>
<p>I started work at GitHub at the end of May 2022.</p>
<p>I work as a Field Security Specialist, which mostly means I help GitHub customers make the most of GitHub&rsquo;s code security products during trials (and sometimes afterwards).</p>
<p>My interest in spoken languages has been fuelled by working with colleagues and customers across Europe - I&rsquo;ve been trying to improve my high-school German and I&rsquo;ve picked up a little Spanish (¡Hola! Hablo un poco de español) for the first time. I&rsquo;m yet to try to put my on-a-whim DuoLingo-acquired Chinese to much use: 我会说一点儿的中文。为什么我学习中文吗？我不知道！There&rsquo;s bits of French (another high school one), Portuguese (a holiday), Ukrainian and Dutch (a work trip) in there too, none at more than a basic level.</p>
